## 🧭 Project Overview
This project explores how **payment type (Card vs Cash)** impacts taxi fares and trip characteristics in New York City.  
It provides **data-driven insights** to help drivers and companies **maximize revenue** by understanding passenger behavior and fare patterns.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To determine whether **payment method** affects the **total fare amount** and **trip distance**, and to recommend strategies that improve driver earnings and overall operational efficiency.

---

## ⚙ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Reporting Tools:** PowerPoint, PDF

## 📊 Dataset Details
**Source:** NYC Taxi Trip Records  
**Columns Used:**  
`passenger_count`, `payment_type`, `fare_amount`, `trip_distance`, `pickup_datetime`, `dropoff_datetime`

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed missing, duplicate, and invalid records  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Analyzed trip and fare distributions by payment type  
3. **Statistical Testing (t-Test)** – Checked whether fare differences between payment types are statistically significant  
4. **Regression Analysis** – Modeled fare as a function of trip distance and payment type  
5. **Visualization** – Created comparative charts for insights  
6. **Reporting** – Summarized results with visuals and business recommendations

## 🔍 Key Insights

Comparison of Card vs Cash payments in NYC Taxi:

| **Metric**           | **Card** | **Cash** |
|:--------------------|:--------|:--------|
| Payment Share        | 67.5%   | 32.5%   |
| Average Fare (USD)   | 13.7    | 12.25   |
| Average Distance (mi)| 3.23    | 2.80    |

**Insights:**
- Card payments are more frequent and yield higher fares.
- t-Test Result: Statistically significant difference → payment type impacts fare.
- Drivers earn ~12% higher revenue per trip with card payments.
